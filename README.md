# 📊 DS-Projects: A Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio Collection

This repository serves as a centralized collection of my major Data Science and Machine Learning projects, showcasing my skills in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, evaluation, and deployment.

Each project resides in its own dedicated subfolder and contains its own detailed `README.md` outlining the problem statement, methodology, results, and key takeaways.
